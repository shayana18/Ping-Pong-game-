# Ping-Pong-game-
In this project I built a two player ping pong type game. The left paddle is controlled with w and s key (w 
= up and s = down) , while the right paddle is controlled using the up and down key. The objective of the 
game is to get the ball to hit the wall behind the opposing paddle. The game functions by ricocheting off 
the top wall, bottom wall and paddles. Each time a person scores the game begins again and the score 
increases for that person. Lastly the ball also increases speed every time it hits a paddle, to mmake it 
increasingly difficult as time passes
